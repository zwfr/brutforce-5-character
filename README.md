## What's a brute force attack ?

A brute force attack is a method used by hackers to attempt to discover a password or encryption key by trying every possible combination until they find the right one. It's a simple but often effective technique, which exploits the vulnerability of weak security systems.

Here's how a brute force attack might be executed:

Target selection: The attacker selects a target

Information gathering: The attacker gathers information about the target

Choice of attack method: The attacker decides on the type of brute force attack to be used. 

Configuring the attack tool: The attacker configures a specialized computer program (script, software or bot).

Launching the attack: The attack tool is launched, and begins systematically testing all possible combinations.

Detection of the right combination: The attack continues until the right combination is found. 

Consequences: Once access has been gained, the attacker can compromise data confidentiality, integrity and availability.

To protect against brute-force attacks, it is essential to employ sound security practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling dual authentication, limiting the number of login attempts and constantly monitoring systems for suspicious activity.
